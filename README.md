- `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
  -  React‚Äôs replacement for using innerHTML in the browser DOM.
  -  Resources: [React Doc](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#dangerouslysetinnerhtml)
- **Typechecking with PropTypes** - üìñ [React doc](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html)

  - When writing React, a common bug - accidentally pass incorrect props to component, and it is difficult to track down these bugs
    - As an example: `age="15"` should be a number, but we pass in as a string, `${age + 5}` would return `155` instead of `20`
  - With PropTypes: easily define exactly what the props should be for a component, you will see errors in inspect when props are incorrect
- **React fragments vs div containers**
  - Component returns multiple elements, to avoid adding extra nodes to the DOM, `<React.Fragment>` let you group a list of children.

## Web Dev
- **How Does a Trailing Slash Impact SEO?** üìñ [Read](https://www.safaridigital.com.au/blog/trailing-slash-seo/)
  - If there are two separate pages with the same content ‚Äì one with a slash at the end of the URL and one without ‚Äì the two separate pages will be identical, resulting in duplicate content. Google has a hard time figuring out which of the two is the original source, and the search engine crawlers are left confused.
- **Everything You Need to Know About rel=‚Äùnoopener noreferrer‚Äù** üìñ [Read](https://clever-solution.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-rel-noopener-noreferrer-tags-purpose-benefits-and-seo-impact/)

## API
- **API design**
  - The process of developing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that expose data and application functionality for use by developers and users
  
- **Differences Between API Documentation, Specifications, and Definitions**
  - All related, but different entities, each serves a crucial purpose
  - **API Documentation:** _Instructions for developers and API consumers how to use the API_
  - **API Specification:** _Provides a broad understanding of the functionality of the API and the expected results_
  - **API Definition:** _Machine consumption of an API, providing machine-readable format for use_
